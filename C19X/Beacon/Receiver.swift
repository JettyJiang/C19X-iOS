 Beacon receiver scans for peripherals with fixed service UUID in foreground and background modes. Background scan
 for Android is trivial as scanForPeripherals will always return all Android devices on every call. Background scan for iOS
 devices that are transmitting in background mode is more complex, requiring an open connection to subscribe to a
 notifying characteristic that is used as trigger for keeping both iOS devices in background state (rather than suspended
 or killed). For iOS - iOS devices, on detection, the receiver will (1) write blank data to the transmitter, which triggers the
 transmitter to send a characteristic data update after 8 seconds, which in turns (2) triggers the receiver to receive a value
 update notification, to (3) create the opportunity for a read RSSI call and repeat of this looped process that keeps both
 devices awake.
 
 Please note, the iOS - iOS process is unreliable if (1) the user switches off bluetooth via Airplane mode settings, (2) the
 device reboots, and (3) it will fail completely if the app has been killed by the user. These are conditions that cannot be
 handled reliably by CoreBluetooth state restoration.
