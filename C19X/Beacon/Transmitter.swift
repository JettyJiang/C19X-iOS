/**
 Transmitter offers a single service with a single characteristic for broadcasting the beacon code as the lower 64-bit
 of the characteristic UUID. The characteristic is also writable to enable non-transmitting Android devices (receive only,
 like the Samsung J6) to make their presence known by writing their beacon code and RSSI as data to this characteristic.
 
 Keeping the transmitter and receiver working in iOS background mode is a major challenge. While it is possible to use
 characteristic notification / subscription to keep the app from being killed, that doesn't last indefinitely in practice, e.g.
 when device goes out of range and bluetooth has been switched on/off while out of range via Airplane mode (see Apple
 documentation for state restoration limitations). The method also requires establishing open ended connections to all
 peripherals which in theory is fine, but in practice causes problems for Android devices. Experiments have found that
 Android devices cannot accept new connections (without explicit disconnect) indefinitely and the bluetooth stack ceases
 to function after around 500 open connections. The device will need to be rebooted to recover. However, if each connection
 is disconnected, the bluetooth stack can work indefinitely on Android devices.
